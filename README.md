# PrivacyTwitterBot

We began this project by first formulating an issue that we felt inspired to address. We are looking at the many cases where technology is collecting seemingly random bits of information and exposing this practice as an invasion of our privacy whether we cognizant of it or not. We decided that we needed a method to display it in a public environment to embellish on growing awareness of this disregard for our privacy. Thus, the (invasive) “Privacy Twitter Bot” was conceived. We have created a platform that can run in the background on your web browser while recording your facial expressions as you use your computer. The information that is taken will then convert into an emoticon or emoji and post it to twitter every second. This stream of posts will allow anyone who follows the Privacy Twitter Bot to know how the user is feeling as they go about their work, education, or recreational use of their time at a computer. 
<br>A few next step ideas:
<br>1.0	While posting an emoji based on your expression, the app would also take screen shots of the pages you are looking at in order to make associations as to what content has different emotional effects on the person viewing it.
<br>2.0	The app could take the form of a wearable device that records info like blood pressure, heart rate, steps taken per day, places often visited, etc.
<br>2.1	The info could then be displayed in some form of data visualization that would continuously collect this information.
<br>2.2	The information would then be viewable in categories such as days, months, years and so on and so forth. 
<br>3.0	The could become the new standard for social media and/or dating service apps. 
<br>3.1	No longer would someone need to base judgements on aesthetic principles alone. Instead, someone could then have list of objective statistics about a person of interest’s mentality of given periods of time.
